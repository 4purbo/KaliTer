# KaliTer
Use this code to modify your termux in an advanced way!!

# Installation
The installation process is very simple, just open your termux and clone this repository; paste the following command to do so.
- `git clone https://github.com/4purbo/KaliTer`

Then enter the 'KaliTer' folder using
- `cd KaliTer`

Now, give the installation file permissions using
- `chmod +x ./install-kaliter.sh`

Okay, only two steps left now; type `./install-kaliter.sh` and click on the star icon in this repository.

That's it! You can now close the current session on your termux and open a new one for the new looks.</br>

# Usage
If its your first time logging into termux after installing kaliter, you will find a login screen wanting a password. The default password was blank, so just press enter to bypass the login.

When you need to change the username or the password of the login screen, you can use this command below:-
- `python ~/../usr/etc/KaliTer/setup.py -u {new_username} -p {new_password}`

Don't forget to replace `{new_username}` and `{new_password}` with actual username and passwords.
